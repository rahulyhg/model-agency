_____________later_____________
make translatable session messages in controllers
look at @backend/rbac and delete if it needs
refactor modImages file input
    during updating, delete images only after submitting form
    during selecting new images, don't delete existing images
    zoom

_____________current_____________
create model
    create migration add_identity_to_mod_table
        table mod
            phone_number
            country_id
            age
            password_hash
    mod model implement IdentityInterface
    create ModSignupForm extends Model
        phoneNumber
fix views
    mod form - hair color and eyes color are shown in default language despite different translations
    hair-color
        remove field id
        format created_at and updated_at
        add HairColor->color (name)
    eyes-color
        remove field id
        format created_at and updated_at
        add HairColor->color (name)
Change HairColor->color to name
Change EyesColor->color to name


filestorage:
    1. active form saves file from field to __FILE__
    2. UploadedFile::getInstance - create object of the file
    3. FileStorage saves UploadedFile object to server and about information to db (through activeRecord File) - returns id

users
    parent class User extends ActiveRecord implements IdentityInterface
        modelProfile extends User
            country
            age
            model_entity - Mod class with personal characteristics
        managerProfile extends User
            company_name todo: check - maybe better way, to have here company_id and in other place Company entity separately

TODO: find out for what I need User module
