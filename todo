mod create - add filestorage for image download
        add to form field fileInput by kartik
        add new Mod field images[]
        add new Mod field images_basket_id
        create migration create_table_images_basket - for saving more then one image for mod
            id
            basket_id - Mod->images_basket_id
            image_id - filestorage file->id
            created_at
            updated_at
            foreign key for image_id
        create migration add_column_images_basket_id_to_table_mod
            add foreign key to images_basket table
        add rule for images_basket_id to Mod model
    see what else could be changed by reason adding new field (images_basket_id) - maybe controller, search model etc
    add function upload to model
        getInstance for every file
        save this through fileStorage
        save id of every uploaded to new imagesBasket object
        save images basket object id to images_basket_id attribute
    see what else could be needed for images (maybe get images in views...) - create new todo_list
fix views
    hair-color
        remove field id
        format created_at and updated_at
        add HairColor->color (name)
    eyes-color
        remove field id
        format created_at and updated_at
        add HairColor->color (name)
Change HairColor->color to name
Change EyesColor->color to name


filestorage:
    1. active form saves file from field to __FILE__
    2. UploadedFile::getInstance - create object of the file
    3. FileStorage saves UploadedFile object to server and about information to db (through activeRecord File) - returns id
